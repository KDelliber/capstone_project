        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>I’m Kenneth Delliber, a passionate IT professional with a deep love for technology, learning, and creativity. Above all, my family is the core of who I am. They have always been a source of strength and inspiration for me. Whether it's through shared experiences, supporting each other, or simply enjoying each other's company, my family has shaped my values and outlook on life. Becoming a stay-at-home dad has changed me a lot, teaching me patience and understanding. It has also sparked a new passion for cooking, and I’ve been enjoying culinary challenges and exploring new recipes.</p>
            <p>My journey in technology began with a fascination for how things work, and this curiosity has driven me to pursue a career in IT. Recently, I made the significant decision to change careers in my 40s, primarily because we had a baby. This new chapter in my life has been incredibly motivating and has reinforced my commitment to building a fulfilling and impactful career in IT.</p>

            <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
            <p><strong>Reading:</strong> My love for reading spans across genres such as fantasy, the classics, history, cosmology, and the natural world. Recently, I’ve been diving into classic literature, enjoying the timeless stories and profound insights they offer. Edgar Allan Poe has always been a favorite of mine, and it’s a unique coincidence that he passed away on my birthday.</p>
            <p><strong>Gaming:</strong> I’m an avid gamer with a diverse taste in games, ranging from Tetris to MMORPGs, sports, and racing. Gaming has taught me invaluable skills such as problem-solving, strategic planning, and teamwork. It’s a hobby that not only entertains but also challenges me to think critically and work collaboratively.</p>
            <p><strong>Cooking:</strong> Recently, I’ve developed a passion for cooking. Living with achalasia, a condition that makes swallowing difficult, has made me appreciate the art of dining even more. It has driven me to explore better culinary experiences and savor each meal more deeply. Embracing new culinary challenges has been a delightful and rewarding experience, allowing me to explore different cuisines and flavors while honing my cooking skills.</p>
            <p><strong>Sports:</strong> I’m also a big sports fan, with a particular love for the NFL and the Boston Red Sox. I enjoy watching most sports and appreciate the dedication and hard work of professional athletes. Watching games and cheering for my favorite teams has always been a great way to relax and enjoy some friendly competition.</p>

            <h2>My Journey into IT</h2>
            <p>Before transitioning into IT, I spent my 20s and 30s working in warehouses, where I learned the value of hard physical work and developed strong inventory management skills. This experience taught me the importance of dedication, teamwork, and perseverance. While I may be relatively new to the IT field, my passion for learning is boundless. I'm driven by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to understand the intricacies of technology. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in network design, cybersecurity, and digital transformation. Every project and assignment has been a stepping stone, allowing me to grow and adapt in this ever-evolving field.</p>
            <p>My diverse interests and hobbies reflect my commitment to continuous learning and my ability to adapt to different challenges. Whether it’s exploring the latest trends in cybersecurity or immersing myself in a captivating book, I approach each experience with curiosity and enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I look forward to connecting with you and exploring new opportunities together.</p>
